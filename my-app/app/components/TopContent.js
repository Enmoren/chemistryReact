          This lead testing kit was created by a team of students at Olin College as a course final project. The course, Paper Panacea pt.1, is an experimental class led by co-learner Linda Vanasupa with the purpose of advancing the technology of paper microfluidic detection platforms in order to advance our ability to detect environmental toxins. The goal of our project was to create a citizen science kit that enabled middle and high school students to learn about lead pollution through a fun and interactive medium, while contributing to a larger crowdsourced dataset.

          Paper microfluidics are devices that are made with paper and wax and use wells and chemicals in order to test for various chemicals and reactions on a small scale that is very cheap. Similar well known technologies are pH testing strips for your pool or pregnancy tests.

          Citizen science enables all members of the community to participate in data collection and understanding. This allows for data to be collected on a large scale and for science to serve regular people in everyday lives rather than be performed in a lab. 

          <p>
          This also allows members of the community to be educated about science and learn more about complicated technologies and concepts through real life activities. This can also lead to more awareness of everything from water content to climate change.
